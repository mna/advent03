# Advent of code 2019

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2019][advent] puzzles, done in the [odin][]
programming language. This is a new-ish, incomplete and in-development programming 
language that I just started using for fun, so the solutions might be less elegant
than they could/should be!

To build, install odin and run:

```
$ odin run main.odin
```
